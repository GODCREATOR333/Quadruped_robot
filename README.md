# Quadruped Spider Robot

## This project was done from 12/04/2023 - 25/04/23 for demonstration purpose to be showcased for Science fest of jntuh-ucesth.

## Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a quadruped spider robot controlled by a mobile phone using Bluetooth technology. The robot uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller, servo motors, and inverse kinematics to achieve stable locomotion through gait generation.

## Objectives
- Develop a quadruped robot using Arduino Uno and servo motors.  
- Implement inverse kinematics and gait generation for realistic movement.  
- Integrate Bluetooth communication for remote control via a smartphone.  
- Calibrate servos to ensure precise movement and functionality.

## Methodology
- **Arduino Uno and Servo Mechanisms**: The robot uses 8 servo motors for movement and is powered by rechargeable batteries. An Arduino Uno microcontroller with an extension board controls the servos.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Inverse kinematics algorithms were used to calculate the precise angles needed for the servos to move the robot's legs, allowing for coordinated, realistic motion.
- **Gait Generation**: Gait patterns were generated and optimized to ensure stable and natural movement, simulating a real quadruped walking cycle.
- **Bluetooth Control**: An HC-05 Bluetooth module was integrated for wireless control, allowing the robot to be operated via a mobile phone app.

## Key Learnings
- **Arduino Coding**: Writing and optimizing code to control servos and handle real-time Bluetooth input.
- **Servo Calibration**: Understanding the importance of calibrating servo motors to ensure precise movement and positioning of the robot's legs.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Applying inverse kinematics for calculating joint angles to achieve the desired positions for each leg during movement.
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Implementing Bluetooth control for a user-friendly, wireless interface between the robot and a smartphone.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the application of Arduino-based control and robotic principles such as inverse kinematics and gait generation. The robot performed well, validating the integration of servo calibration and wireless Bluetooth control.

## Future Work
- Optimize the gait generation algorithm for smoother, more natural movements.
- Enhance the Bluetooth control interface to improve user experience and add more features.
- Explore power efficiency improvements to extend battery life.
